### The Project

Pathfinding is a project which goal is to compare pathfinding algorithms' performances. It has a beautiful and minimalist interface to help people understanding how these algorithms work and how fast they are.

Source code and macOS app are available.

### Supported algoritms

* A*
* Dijkstra
* Greedy

### Development

Pathfinding was coded in Swift 3 for macOS.
